## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **each Microsoft Teams step will need the team name and channel name updated to suit your Teams environment!** Edit the input with the preset text of `change_me` in each Teams step in the workflow. The following steps will need to be updated in this workflow:
* `!lookup-vuln Trigger`
* `Searching Notification`
* `Vulnerability Not Found Notification`
* `Multiple Results Notification`
* `Post Vulnerability Info`
* `Post Vulns (Multiple Results)` (inside the `Loop over URLs` loop step)

After updating the steps with your Microsoft Teams configuration, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.
