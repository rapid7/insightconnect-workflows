# Description

Disabling a compromised account can limit the scope of an attack and buy valuable time to investigate and contain the threat. This workflow disables a domain user account with a command in Microsoft Teams.

Sample Slack Trigger Commands:

`!disable-user-ad <exampleuser>`

# Key Features

* **Break the Kill Chain** - Credentials provide attackers with easy access to numerous targets. Disabling a compromised account or forcing a password reset can quickly and effectively interrupt an attackerâ€™s kill chain.
* **Buy Time to Investigate and Remediate** - In a pinch, disabling a user account can limit your threat exposure and buy your team valuable time to investigate and contain a threat. 
* **Reduce Portal Fatigue** - You have enough to do without logging into a different solution every 5 minutes. Control your response actions from chat instead.

# Requirements

* [Microsoft Teams](https://insightconnect.help.rapid7.com/docs/microsoft-teams)
* Active Directory connection

# Documentation

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **The `Find DN` step and each Microsoft Teams step will need to be updated to suit your Microsoft Teams and LDAP environments.** Edit the input with the preset text of `change_me` in each of these steps in the workflow.

After configuring the Teams steps, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.

To run the workflow, send a message to the specified Microsoft Teams channel starting with the command `!disable-user-ad`.

Commands should be in the following format:

The workflow will post the results in a thread.
