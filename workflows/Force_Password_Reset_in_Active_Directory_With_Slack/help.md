# Description

Reset a domain user's password with a command in Slack. Quickly respond, whether it be to an emerging threat or to another user that locked themselves out of their account.

Sample Slack command:

`reset-password-ad jdoe`

# Key Features

* **Break the Kill Chain** - Credentials provide attackers with easy access to numerous targets. Disabling a compromised account or forcing a password reset can quickly and effectively interrupt an attackerâ€™s kill chain.
* **Buy Time to Investigate and Remediate** - In a pinch, disabling a user account can limit your threat exposure and buy your team valuable time to investigate and contain a threat. Disabling the user may not remediate the root cause, but it can mitigate the immediate risk while you work on fixing underlying issues.
* **Minimize Disruption to the User** - Forcing a user to reset their password is a small inconvenience compared to re-imaging their entire system. Acting fast can save valuable time and teach a valuable lesson without a noticeable impact to your business.

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, the `Find DN` step will need the Search Base field to be defined. Edit the workflow, open the `Find DN` step, and provide the appropriate Search Base for your domain. For example, if your domain is `acme.com` then the Search Base would be `DC=acme,DC=com`.

After updating the `Find DN` step, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.

### Usage

*This workflow will trigger in any direct messages to your Chatbot **or** any message in a channel directed @ your Chatbot. Note the Chatbot must be in the channel in order to trigger the workflow this way.*

To run the workflow, send a direct message to your InsightConnect Slack Chatbot or @ your Chatbot in a public channel starting with the command `reset-password-ad`. Use the target user's username, not the full email address.

For example, in a direct message to your Chatbot:
* `reset-password-ad jdoe`

For example, in a channel with your Chatbot:
* `@Rapid7 InsightConnect reset-password-ad jdoe`

The workflow will post the results in a thread.
