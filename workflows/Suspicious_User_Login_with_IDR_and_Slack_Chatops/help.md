# Description

Suspicious User Login with InsightIDR and Slack automates the process of validating IPs against other office locations tracked in a global artifact and if no match is found, escalates the alert via Slack chatbot to the security team. 

# Key Features

* Parses IP addresses and looks up Geolocation with Whois
* Every location is compared to the Office Location Global Artifact
* If there is not a match, the InsightConnect workflow will then automatically create a ticket in Jira and escalate alert details to security via Slack Chatbot for a user response.
* Based if the responder confirms that the user is traveling, the ticket will be transitioned to a closed state.
* If the alert is truly suspicious, the workflow will query for the user in Active Directory and disabled.

# Requirements

* InsightConnect Orchestrator Deployed
* Slack Chatbot
* Active Directory Connection
