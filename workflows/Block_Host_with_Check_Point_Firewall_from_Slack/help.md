# Documentation

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **each Slack step will need the channel name updated to suit your Slack environment!** Edit the input with the preset text of `change_me` in each Slack step in the workflow.

After configuring the Slack steps, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.
 
An optional whitelist can be added to the Check Point `Add Host to be Blocked` action. To use this list add IP addresses or CIDR IP addresses in the following format `["198.51.100.100", "198.51.100.1/32"]`

By default this workflow will automatically skip blocking private IP addresses. To block these, set the `Skip RFC 1918` option to false in the `Add Host to be Blocked` step.

### Usage

*This workflow will only trigger in the channel specified in the Slack workflow steps.*

To run the workflow, send a message to the specified Slack channel starting with the command `@Rapid7 InsightConnect block-host` or `unblock-host`.

Your chat bot will reply when the workflow completes.
