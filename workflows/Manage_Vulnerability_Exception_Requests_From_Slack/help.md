# Key Features

* Review vulnerability exception details in a well-formatted Slack message
* Decide to approve or reject the exception request from Slack

# Documentation

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

After import, edit the workflow Settings step. Change the channel name from the default `#secops` to a Slack channel of your choice. The workflow will post new vulnerability exception requests to this channel. Also adjust the `auto-threshold` variable to indicate the maximum CVSS score for which vulnerability exception requests will be automatically approved. By default, this workflow will automatically approve vulnerability exception requests for vulnerabilities with a CVSS risk score equal to 0. To ensure no exception requests are approved automatically, set this value to a negative number (eg, -1). 

Once your environmental settings have been applied, activate the workflow. It will trigger upon newly submitted vulnerability exception requests.

NOTE: This workflow will NOT trigger on *re*submitted exception requests at this time. Please rely on conventional methods, such as talking to each other, to manage resubmissions.

## Usage

This workflow will trigger automatically on new vulnerability exception requests in the InsightVM Console.
