## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **update the first step with the channel name to suit your Slack environment** by editing the input with the preset text of `change_me` to match the channel to monitor.

After configuring the Slack steps, activate the workflow in order to trigger it with a Slack command.
