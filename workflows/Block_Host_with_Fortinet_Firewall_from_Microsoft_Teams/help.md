# Documentation

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **each Microsoft Teams step will need the team name and channel name updated to suit your Teams environment!** Edit the input with the preset text of `change_me` in each Teams step in the workflow.

After configuring the Teams steps, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.
 
An optional whitelist can be added to the FortiGate `Add Host to be Blocked` action. To use this list add IP addresses or domains in the following format `["198.51.100.100", "example.com", "198.51.100.1"]`

By default this workflow will automatically skip blocking private IP addresses. To block these, set the `Skip RFC 1918` option to false in the `Add Host to be Blocked` step.

### Usage

*This workflow will only trigger in the channel specified in the Microsoft Teams workflow steps.*

To run the workflow, send a message to the specified Microsoft Teams channel starting with the command `!block-host` or `unblock-host`.

Your chat bot will reply when the workflow completes.
