# Description

This workflow accepts a Slack command containing an IP address. This IP address will be checked against a pre-defined address group in Fortinet to determine if the IP address is present or not. It is assumed that this address group will be used to store IP addresses for a block policy. A message with the results will be returned.

Sample Slack Trigger Commands:

`@Rapid7 InsightConnect block-status 198.51.100.100`
`@Rapid7 InsightConnect block-status example.com`

# Key Features

# Documentation

## Setup

Once the workflow has been imported, **Update the first step with the channel name to suit your Slack environment!** by editing the input with the preset text of `change_me` to match the channel to monitor.
And in the _Check for IP_ step edit the Address Group Name input from `change_me` to an appropriate address group to monitor.

To run the workflow, @ your Slackbot in the chosen channel or in a direct message along with the command "block-status <IP>". The workflow will post responses in a thread.
