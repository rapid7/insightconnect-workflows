# Description

This workflow accepts a Microsoft Teams command containing a list of hosts. These hosts will be checked against a pre-defined address group in Cisco ASA to determine whether or not the IP address is present. It is assumed that this address group will be used to store IP addresses for a block policy. A message with the results will be returned.

Sample Microsoft Teams Trigger Commands:

`!block-status 198.51.100.100`

`!block-status example.com`

`!block-status 198.51.100.100 example.com`

# Key Features
