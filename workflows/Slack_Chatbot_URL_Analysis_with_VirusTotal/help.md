# Description

Lookup and enrich suspicious URLs and domains with a simple Slack command. URL and domain analysis provided by VirusTotal is returned in a Slack thread.

Sample Slack Trigger Commands:

`enrich-url example.com`

`enrich-url www.example.com`

`enrich-url https://www.example.com`

# Key Features

* **Investigate Indicators at Scale** - Manually investigating every reported phishing attempt is extremely difficult to scale. Automatic analysis of common phishing IOCs reduces the overhead associated with every reported incident.
* **Offload Repetitive Tasks** - Parsing out, analyzing, and enriching URLs manually can be repetitive and mind-numbing. Give that time back to your team so you can elevate your focus to identifying and resolving threats.
* **Shorten the Investigation Timeline** - Manage timely responses to real attacks by eliminating the investigation of false positives and spam. If the URLs are found to be malicious, pivot seamlessly to incident response.

# Requirements

* [Slack](https://insightconnect.help.rapid7.com/docs/configure-slack-for-chatops)
* VirusTotal API Key

# Documentation

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

After import, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.

### Usage

*This workflow will only trigger in direct messages to your Slackbot. This is by design to avoid posting potentially malicious URLs in shared Slack channels.*

To run the workflow, send a direct message to your InsightConnect Slack Chatbot starting with the command `enrich-url`. 

For example:

* `enrich-url badsite.com`
* `enrich-url http://another.badsite.com`

The workflow will post the results in a thread.
