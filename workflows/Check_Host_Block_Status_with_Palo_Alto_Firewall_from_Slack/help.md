# Description

This workflow accepts a Slack command containing an IP address or domain. This object will be checked against a pre-defined address group in a Palo Alto firewall to determine if the object is present or not. It is assumed that this address group will be used to store address objects for a block policy. A message with the results will be returned.

Multiple hosts can be specified in one command

Sample Slack Trigger Commands:

`@Rapid7 InsightConnect block-status 198.51.100.100`

`@Rapid7 InsightConnect block-status 198.51.100.100 198.51.100.101`

`@Rapid7 InsightConnect block-status example.com`

# Key Features

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **Update the first step with the channel name to suit your Slack environment!** by editing the input with the preset text of `change_me` to match the channel to monitor.

To run the workflow, @ your Slackbot or in a direct message along with the command "block-status <host>". The workflow will post responses in a thread.

For example:

* `@Rapid7 InsightConnect block-host example.com`
* `@Rapid7 InsightConnect block-host 198.10.198.100`
* `@Rapid7 InsightConnect block-host 198.10.198.100 198.10.198.101`
