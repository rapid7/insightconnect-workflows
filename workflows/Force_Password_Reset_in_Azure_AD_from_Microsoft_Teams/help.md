# Description

Reset a user's password straight from Microsoft Teams. Respond quickly, albeit to contain a potential threat or to reset another user's locked out account.

Sample Microsoft Teams Trigger Commands:

`!reset_password user@example.com`

# Key Features

* **Break the Kill Chain** - Credentials provide attackers with easy access to numerous targets. Disabling a compromised account or forcing a password reset can quickly and effectively interrupt an attacker’s kill chain.
* **Minimize Disruption to the User** - Forcing a user to reset their password is a small inconvenience compared to re-imaging their entire system. Acting fast can save valuable time and teach a valuable lesson without a noticeable impact to your business.
* **Make Persistence Inconsistent** - Attackers love using credentials for persistent access to networks or cloud applications. Changing a compromised password is the easiest way to cut off an attacker’s access to your systems and data.

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **each Microsoft Teams step will need the team name and channel name updated to suit your Teams environment!** Edit the input with the preset text of `change_me` in each Teams step in the workflow.

After configuring the Teams steps and the `Find DN` step, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.

### Usage
