# Description

This workflow will scan a Microsoft Teams channel for a specific message. When the workflow detects a message matching that signature, it will automatically scan the URL in VirusTotal and return the results to Microsoft Teams.

# Key Features

* **Investigate Indicators at Scale** - Manually investigating every reported phishing attempt is extremely difficult to scale. Automatic analysis of common phishing IOCs reduces the overhead associated with every reported incident.
* **Offload Repetitive Tasks** - Parsing out, analyzing, and enriching URLs manually can be repetitive and mind-numbing. Give that time back to your team so you can elevate your focus to identifying and resolving threats.
* **Shorten the Investigation Timeline** - Manage timely responses to real attacks by eliminating the investigation of false positives and spam. If the URLs are found to be malicious, pivot seamlessly to incident response.

# Requirements

* [Microsoft Teams](https://insightconnect.help.rapid7.com/docs/microsoft-teams)
* VirusTotal API Key

# Documentation

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **each Microsoft Teams step will need the team name and channel name updated to suit your Teams environment!** Edit the input with the preset text of `change_me` in each Teams step in the workflow.

After configuring the Teams step, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.

### Usage

*This workflow will only trigger in the channel specified in the Microsoft Teams workflow steps.*

To run the workflow, send a message to the specified Microsoft Teams channel starting with the command `!enrich-url`. 

For example:

* `!enrich-url badsite.com`
* `!enrich-url http://another.badsite.com`
