## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Update the first step with the channel name to suit your Slack environment by editing the input with the preset text of `change_me` to match the channel to monitor.

## Usage

To run the workflow, send a direct message to your InsightConnect Slack Chatbot or @ your Chatbot in a public channel starting with the command `delete-asset`.

For example:
`@Rapid7 InsightConnect delete-asset 12345`

You can also delete multiple assets at once. For example:
