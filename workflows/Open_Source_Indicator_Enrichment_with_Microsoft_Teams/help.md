# Documentation

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.
Once the workflow has been imported, each Microsoft Teams step will need the team name and channel name updated to suit your Teams environment (edit the input with the preset text of `change_me`).
To run the workflow, send the command `!investigate <command> <data>` in your configured team and channel. The workflow will post after it has completed.
In the Team and chanel inputs replace `change_me` with the appropriate team and channel.

To run the workflow, in the configured channel enter the command `!investigate <command> <data>`.
 Example: `!investigate ip 8.8.8.8`

Alternatively, use `!investigate help` for more information and examples. The workflow will post with the results of the lookup.

## Technical Details

Plugins utilized by workflow:

|Plugin|Version|Count|
|----|----|--------|
|Dig|1.0.3|1|
|Team Cymru MHR|1.0.3|1|
|Microsoft Teams|2.0.2|6|
|WHOIS|1.0.7|2|

## Troubleshooting

In some instances using copy & paste for `!investigate` commands may introduce unicode characters.
These characters may be misinterpreted by the workflow, resulting in the help response triggering for
what appear to be valid commands. It is recommended to avoid copying & pasting commands.
