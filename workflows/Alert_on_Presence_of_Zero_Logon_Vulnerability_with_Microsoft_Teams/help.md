# Description

This workflow listens for InsightVM Webhook Events for newly discovered vulnerabilities, checks if a Zero Logon (CVE-2020-1472 or derivitave) vulnerability is present, and if found, posts a notification to a Microsoft Teams channel.

This workflow helps Security and IT teams have awareness of this critical high-risk vulnerability. The Slack message posted includes a link to more information about the specific version of the vulnerability, along with host information regarding the vulnerable asset and the solution details for remediation.

# Key Features

* Heightened awareness of this critical vulnerability in your environment

## Setup

**In order to use this workflow, you will need to subscribe to the InsightVM Vulnerabilities Found webhook event. You will also need to adjust the Microsoft Teams team and channel names to match your environment.**

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, open the workflow and view the InsightVM Events trigger step. Save the trigger configuration step and proceed through the Instructions on subscribing to the InsightVM Vulnerabilities Found Webhook Event. This will require an [Insight Platform User API Key](https://docs.rapid7.com/insight/managing-platform-api-keys#generating-a-user-key). Insert your User API Key, copy the API request, run it from a command prompt, and look for a JSON response including an ID. If you receive a JSON response, then your webhook event subscription is active! Close your command prompt and return to the workflow in InsightConnect.

After subscribing to the vulnerabilities found webhook event, return to the workflow editor and click the "Loop Over found Vulnerabilities" loop. Within the loop, click on the "Post to Microsoft Teams" step, and change the Team and Channel fields from `change_me` to the desired team and channel for the Teams environment where you would like vulnerability notifications delivered. We recommend a private channel with representatives from security and remediation teams for the best visibility.

After configuring Teams, activate the workflow. Any newly discovered vulnerability will generate a webhook event, which will trigger your workflow. If the vulnerability is a Zero Logon vulnerability or related, then the workflow will trigger a message with details to the specified Teams channel!

### Adapting the Workflow to New Vulnerabilities

By default, the workflow detects specific vulnerabilities matching or containing the Zero Logon CVE: CVE-2020-1472. It can be easily updated for other pressing vulnerabilities by changing the ID within the "Is Zero Logon?" decision step within the "Loop Over found Vulnerabilities" loop. See InsightConnect's Help Documentation for more information on [using decision steps](https://docs.rapid7.com/insightconnect/lesson-4-use-decision-steps/#lesson-4-use-decision-steps) and on the [decision query language](https://docs.rapid7.com/insightconnect/format-query-language/#operators).
