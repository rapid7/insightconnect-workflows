# Description

Threat Intelligence doesnâ€™t have to come with a cost. This workflow uses open-source intelligence (OSINT) to perform domain lookups, header analysis, hash analysis, and more directly from Slack. Just connect Slack and activate this instant indicator enrichment workflow.

Sample Trigger Commands:

`!enrich-indicator 8.8.8.8`

`!enrich-indicator rapid7.com`

`!enrich-indicator 009f1e9b72cfb6daa3de82093a755bdb3685e0eb`

# Key Features

* **Automation in Minutes** - Get your first automation workflow up and running in minutes with this connectionless enrichment workflow.
* **Investigate Indicators at Scale** - Manually investigating every reported phishing attempt is extremely difficult to scale. Automatic analysis of common phishing IOCs reduces the overhead associated with every reported incident.
* **Shorten the Investigation Timeline** - Manage timely responses to real attacks by eliminating the investigation of false positives and spam. If the URLs are found to be malicious, pivot seamlessly to incident response.

# Requirements

* [Microsoft Teams](https://insightconnect.help.rapid7.com/docs/microsoft-teams)

# Documentation

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **each Microsoft Teams step will need the team name and channel name updated to suit your Teams environment!** Edit the input with the preset text of `change_me` in each Teams step in the workflow.

After configuring the Teams steps, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.

### Usage

*This workflow will only trigger in the channel specified in the Microsoft Teams workflow steps.*

To run the workflow, send a message to the specified Microsoft Teams channel starting with the command `!enrich-indicator`. 

Commands should be in the following format:
`!enrich-indicator <indicator>`

`!enrich-indicator ip 8.8.8.8`
`!enrich-indicator url badsite.com`
`!enrich-indicator hash 009f1e9b72cfb6daa3de82093a755bdb3685e0eb`


Alternatively, use `!enrich-indicator help` for more information and examples. 

The workflow will post the results in a thread.
