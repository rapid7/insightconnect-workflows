# Description

Threat Intelligence doesnâ€™t have to come with a cost. This workflow uses open-source intelligence (OSINT) to perform domain lookups, header analysis, hash analysis, and more directly from Microsoft Teams. Just connect Microsoft Teams and activate this instant indicator enrichment workflow.

Sample Trigger Commands:

`!enrich-indicator 8.8.8.8`

`!enrich-indicator rapid7.com`

`!enrich-indicator 009f1e9b72cfb6daa3de82093a755bdb3685e0eb`

# Key Features

* **Automation in Minutes** - Get your first automation workflow up and running in minutes with this connectionless enrichment workflow.
* **Investigate Indicators at Scale** - Manually investigating every reported phishing attempt is extremely difficult to scale. Automatic analysis of common phishing IOCs reduces the overhead associated with every reported incident.
* **Shorten the Investigation Timeline** - Manage timely responses to real attacks by eliminating the investigation of false positives and spam. If the URLs are found to be malicious, pivot seamlessly to incident response.

# Requirements

* [Microsoft Teams](https://insightconnect.help.rapid7.com/docs/microsoft-teams)

# Documentation

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

This workflow leverages InsightConnect's Parameters feature. This feature allows variables used multiple times throughout a workflow to be entered once and then referenced throughout the workflow.

There are two parameters you will need to configure in order to complete setup of your workflow:
* `team name`: The Microsoft Teams team name in your environment where the workflow should be triggered and respond
* `channel name`: The Microsoft Teams channel name in your environment where the workflow should be triggered and respond

To begin, select "Parameters" either from the Workflow Control Panel or from the Builder to begin configuration.

After configuring the parameters, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.

### Usage

*This workflow will only trigger in the channel specified in the Microsoft Teams workflow steps.*

To run the workflow, send a message to the specified Microsoft Teams channel starting with the command `!enrich-indicator`. 

Commands should be in the following format:
`!enrich-indicator <indicator>`

`!enrich-indicator ip 8.8.8.8`
`!enrich-indicator url badsite.com`
`!enrich-indicator hash 009f1e9b72cfb6daa3de82093a755bdb3685e0eb`


Alternatively, use `!enrich-indicator help` for more information and examples. 

The workflow will post the results in a thread.
