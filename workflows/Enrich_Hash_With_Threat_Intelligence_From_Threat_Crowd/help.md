# Description

This workflow is meant to introduce InsightIDR users to plugins, actions, and running workflows. The workflow uses an API trigger, which accepts a single string input, to lookup a hash in Threat Crowd, a free-to-use threat intelligence service. This workflow is easy to test out for users who are new to InsightConnect and automation workflows.

**To run this workflow**, simply activate it with the toggle and click `Run` in the `...` menu. Paste an MD5 hash into the input field and click `Run Workflow`. That's it!
* Here's a sample hash to use as an input: `02914C82CDFC5504242B4C47B09FCEC1`.
