## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **the trigger and Settings step will both need to be updated to properly define the team name and channel name used by the workflow!** Edit the input with the preset text of `changeme` for both values in the step. In addition, the workflow will restrict the number of AttackerKB exploits returned based on the `max exploits` configuration in the same Settings step. By default a max of 10 exploits will be returned; however, this can be modified as needed.

After updating the Settings step with your Microsoft Teams configuration, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.

## Usage

*This workflow will only trigger in the channel specified in the Microsoft Teams workflow steps.*

To run the workflow, in the channel you are monitoring send a message to Insight Connect using `!lookup-vuln <search term>`.

For example:
* `!vuln-check CVE-2020-0674`
