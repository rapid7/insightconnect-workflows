## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **the first Microsoft Teams step will need the team name and channel name updated to suit your Microsoft Teams environment!** Edit the input with the preset text of `change_me` in the first Microsoft Teams step in the workflow.

After configuring the first Microsoft Teams step, activate the workflow and then issue a Microsoft Teams command to trigger it. 

### Usage

*This workflow will only trigger in the channel specified in the Microsoft Teams workflow steps.*

To run the workflow, send a message to the configured Microsoft Teams channel starting with the command `!enrich-cve` and then provide the CVE ID, in upper or lowercase format, of the vulnerability you would like to get more details on.

For example:
* `!enrich-cve CVE-2019-0708`

The workflow will reply when it completes.
