# Description

Quarantine an endpoint in CylanceOPTICS from a Microsoft Teams command. This workflow supports endpoints in the form of IP address and/or MAC address.

More than one endpoint can be specified within a single command.

Sample Microsoft Teams Trigger Commands:

`!quarantine-endpoint 08:00:27:33:9F:CE`

`!quarantine-endpoint 10.0.2.15 08:00:27:33:9F:CE`

When you log into CylancePROTECT, choose "CylanceOPTICS" from the left side-bar menu. The quarantined endpoints can be found on the "Devices" tab. When the "Device Status" is set to "Locked Down", the endpoint is quarantined. 

**Note**: Cylance does not support undoing the lockdown from the API, as the network access is fully removed for the endpoint.

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **each Microsoft Teams step will need the channel and team name updated to suit your Microsoft Teams environment!** Edit the input with the preset text of `change_me` in each Microsoft Teams step in the workflow.

After configuring the Microsoft Teams steps, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.
