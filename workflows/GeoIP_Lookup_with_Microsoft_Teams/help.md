# Description

Use a Slack command to geolocate an IP address using IPStack's geoip database.

Sample Microsoft Teams Trigger Commands:

`!geoip <IP Address>`

# Key Features

* **Leverage Trusted Tools** - Attackers often spoof emails to make them look like they were sent from somewhere else. Leverage the tools at your disposal to investigate and enrich indicators automatically.
* **Investigate Indicators at Scale** - Manually investigating every reported phishing attempt is extremely difficult to scale. Automatic analysis of common phishing IOCs reduces the overhead associated with every reported incident.
* **Pinpoint a Targeted Response** - Positively identifying a malicious IP address allows you to block the phishing campaignâ€™s origin, mitigating the risk of repeated attacks from that same source.

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **each Microsoft Teams step will need the team name and channel name updated to suit your Teams environment!** Edit the input with the preset text of `change_me` in each Teams step in the workflow.

After configuring the Teams steps, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.

### Usage

*This workflow will only trigger in the channel specified in the Microsoft Teams workflow steps.*

To run the workflow, send a message to the specified Microsoft Teams channel starting with the command `!geoip <IP address>`. 

Commands should be in the following format:
* `!geoip 8.8.8.8`
* `!geoip 2001:4860:4860::8888`

The workflow will post the results in a thread.
