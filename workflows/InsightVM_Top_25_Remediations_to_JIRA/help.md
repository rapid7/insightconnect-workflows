## Setup

Once the workflow has been downloaded, login to InsightConnect and “Import” it into the workflow builder. Once imported, you will initially be prompted to configure the connections for each of the plugins.

Two steps need to be updated to reflect the local JIRA environment.
* In the "Process Remediations" loop, change the "Search for Existing Issue" step's JQL input. "Test Project" must be the name of the project in JIRA that will be searched for issues.
* In the "Process Remediations" loop, change the "Create Issue" step's Project input. "TP" must be the ID of the project in JIRA where the issue will be created.
